Here’s a clean, professional README.md format for your PQBFL (Privacy-preserving Quantum-Based Federated Learning) project — ready for GitHub 👇

🧠 PQBFL – Privacy-preserving Quantum-Based Federated Learning

PQBFL is a cutting-edge framework combining Federated Learning (FL) with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for secure, decentralized model training.
It leverages a local Ethereum blockchain (via Ganache) for coordination and IPFS for decentralized model and data storage.

🔁 Step-by-Step Setup
1. Clone the Project
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd pqbfl

2. Install Ganache (Local Ethereum Blockchain)

Download Ganache from the official Truffle Suite website
.

Ganache simulates a local Ethereum blockchain for testing.

3. Install Python Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Compile Post-Quantum Cryptography Library
git clone https://github.com/kpdemetriou/pqcrypto.git
cd pqcrypto
sudo python3 compile.py


This compiles the C-based PQC primitives (used for CKKS/BFV encryption).

5. Setup and Run Infrastructure
🔨 1. Compile & Deploy the Smart Contract
cd contract
python compile-deploy.py <ETH_ADDRESS> <PRIVATE_KEY>


<ETH_ADDRESS> and <PRIVATE_KEY> come from Ganache

Upon success, you’ll get a contract address
👉 Save this — it’s required for both server and client

Note: Use the server’s Ethereum credentials during deployment.

📦 2. Install & Run IPFS

Download IPFS (Kubo) from here
.

Extract the folder (e.g., C:\ipfs) and add ipfs.exe to your Environment Variables.

Then initialize and start IPFS:

ipfs init
ipfs daemon


Keep this terminal running.

🚀 Running PQBFL

Open two terminals — one for the Server, one for the Participant (Client).

▶️ Server
python pqbfl.py -m server \
  -c <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  -ek <ETH_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  -idor <PROJECT_ID> \
  -r <NUM_ROUNDS> \
  -p <NUM_PARTICIPANTS> \
  -d <DATASET> \
  -H <ENCRYPTION_TYPE>

🧑‍💻 Participant (Client)
python pqbfl.py -m participant \
  -c <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  -ek <ETH_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  -e <NUM_EPOCHS> \
  -d <DATASET> \
  -H <ENCRYPTION_TYPE>

🧩 Parameters Reference
Parameter	Description
<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>	Smart contract address from deploy step
<ETH_PRIVATE_KEY>	Ethereum private key (from Ganache)
<PROJECT_ID>	Unique ID for the FL project
<NUM_ROUNDS>	Number of federated training rounds
<NUM_PARTICIPANTS>	Number of clients expected
<NUM_EPOCHS>	Local training epochs per client
<DATASET>	Dataset name: MNIST or UCI_HAR
<ENCRYPTION_TYPE>	Encryption scheme: CKKS or BFV
✅ Example Commands
Server
python pqbfl.py -m server -c 0xAbc123... -ek a1b2c3... -idor proj01 -r 5 -p 3 -d MNIST -H CKKS

Client
python pqbfl.py -m participant -c 0xAbc123... -ek f6e7d8... -e 10 -d MNIST -H CKKS

📌 Notes

Ensure Ganache and IPFS daemon are running before executing scripts.

Always keep your private keys secure.

The encryption scheme (CKKS/BFV) must match between the server and all clients.

PQBFL is modular — you can integrate new datasets, models, or encryption schemes easil
